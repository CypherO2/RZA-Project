      <h1>Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement</h1>
      
      <p>
        This statement is published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
      </p>

      <h2>Commitment and Policy</h2>

      <p>
        [Insert organization name] is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. We implement effective systems and controls to reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking within our organization and supply chains.
      </p>

      <h2>Areas of Risk</h2>

      <p>
        We have identified several areas of heightened risk in our operations:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Overseas conservation partners</li>
        <li>Overseas suppliers of retail merchandise</li>
        <li>Construction contractors and subcontractors</li>
        <li>Suppliers of fresh produce for catering and animal feed</li>
        <li>Our own staff and volunteers</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Due Diligence</h2>

      <p>
        We undertake due diligence to reduce the risk of human trafficking and slavery within our operations and supply chains. We obtain written confirmation from conservation partners and evidence of compliance with the Modern Slavery Act from suppliers with significant expenditures.
      </p>

      <h2>Employee Measures</h2>

      <p>
        We ensure that employees are in control of their earnings by verifying any changes to bank details.
      </p>

      <h2>Supply Chain Management</h2>

      <p>
        We engage with a large number of suppliers, many of whom are required to produce a Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement under the Act. We expect suppliers to comply with our Procurement Policy, relevant laws, and undertake due diligence in their own supply chains.
      </p>

      <h2>Conservation Partners</h2>

      <p>
        We extend our commitment to combating modern slavery to our conservation partners, expecting them to conform to the Act and thoroughly investigate their labor practices and those of their suppliers.
      </p>

      <h2>Training</h2>

      <p>
        A training program is in place to ensure management staff are aware of their responsibilities under the Act and how to identify and escalate concerns related to modern slavery.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Actions</h2>

      <p>
        We will continue to deliver training courses, obtain compliance confirmation from new suppliers and partners, and review and update this statement annually.
