## Description

### Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a full-stack web application for a combined Zoo and Hotel, offering functionalities such as room booking, ticket ordering, membership purchases, rewards points management, and more. The web application will be built using modern technologies including React, Bootstrap, React-bootstrap, MDBootstrap, and Axios for the frontend, and a Python backend powered by Flask for handling user authentication, data storage, and encryption.

### Features

1. **Room Booking:** Users can browse available rooms, view details, and book rooms for their stay at the hotel.

2. **Ticket Ordering:** Visitors can purchase tickets for zoo entry, select ticket types, and make payments securely online.

3. **Membership Purchases:** Users have the option to become members of the zoo, with benefits such as discounts on tickets and exclusive access to events.

4. **Rewards Points Management:** Members can manage their rewards points earned through purchases and redeem them for various rewards offered by the zoo and hotel.

5. **User Authentication:** Secure login/signup functionality will be implemented using Flask, with user details stored in a database and passwords encrypted using bcrypt.

6. **Accessibility Features:** The application will incorporate accessibility features to ensure inclusivity for all users, although the specifics of these features will be determined during the development phase.

7. **Staff Dashboards:** Staff members will have access to dedicated dashboards for managing bookings, tickets, memberships, rewards, and other administrative tasks.

### Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, Bootstrap, React-bootstrap, MDBootstrap, Axios
- Backend: Python Flask, SQLite3 (for database interaction)
- Encryption: bcrypt for password hashing, cryptography for additional encryption needs

### Project Goals

- Develop a user-friendly and intuitive web application interface for seamless user experience.
- Implement secure user authentication and data storage mechanisms to protect user information.
- Ensure scalability and maintainability of the application for future updates and enhancements.
- Deliver a polished and professional product that meets the requirements and expectations of the client.

### Conclusion

This project will combine the functionalities of a zoo and hotel into a single web application, providing users with a convenient platform for booking accommodations, purchasing tickets, and managing memberships and rewards points. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices in web development, we aim to deliver a robust and feature-rich application that meets the needs of both the business and its customers.
